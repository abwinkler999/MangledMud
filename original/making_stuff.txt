Using tt++ (I have set-up a macro to connect):
./run then press F2

#log o mylog.raw

#end

first connected as the wizard:

>connect wizard potrzebie

For fun, created a room "The Stairwell"

>@dig The Stairwell

returns 35

Now I want to connect this to the Entrance (#2)

@open s=2

And open in the other direction (go into the other room)!

@open n=35

Yay, can go south! Lets make the room more interesting!

>@desc s=South is the Entrance hall, you can hear noise
>@succ s=You stroll into the party!
>@osucc n=enters the party
>@desc here=A blue stairwell, slightly fading, in front of you is a blue door with a lovely letter box and a small brass plaque. The party lies to the south.

Now lets make the letter box and plaque objects

>@open letterbox=here
>@lock letterbox=me&!me
>@desc letterbox=Well it is a letterbox!
>@fail letterbox=You can't fit!
>@ofail hole=can't fit through the hole

>look letterbox (gives the description)

! can't lock it to fail, the program keeps failing!
! debugger!?!?

! Just make a person called nobody, then lock to nobody :-)
! Seems to work

Home: Want people to start in the right place, also objects can have homes

New objects:
>@create statue=10
>@link statue=here (home set)

When an object is dropped send it somewhere (from a location):
> @link #23=home
> drop statue (then goes home) I think setting STICKY flag would also work and is universal.

How to give people the ability to build more?
Note, @open creates an exit, if you specify a number it goes on to link. Without the number the exit can be used by anyone.

matthew>@dig tunnel (worked #41)
wizard>@open feet=
matthew>@open feet=41 (worked and I can go and set the description)
wizard>@set here=LINK_OK (not sure if I need to do this or not - I think it allows you to link back)

Yes - It implies someone can place a link back to this room, I probably want to set it on all the rooms

Want people to be able to build stuff without my help. Does this mean I have to go round doing lots of @open's? Or may-be people ask me? Then-again I would like people to be able to update descriptions. I think that (for total mayhem) I should make everyone wizards! But this might be a bad idea :-)

** LOOK AT THE SOURCE CODE, WHAT FLAGS CAN I SET? **

How to stop yourself being robbed
>@lock me=me

! set pennies or give (prefer to have a set amount initially)


** EXITS **

Ok, I suggest setting all available links in the initial descriptions and LINK_OK to all start rooms. The question is, can I lock a link so people can't move it? Lets try!

In the front room (11), add an exit (new direction - up), this is unlinked, lets see if matthew can pick it up. NOTE: LINK_OK set in room
wizard>@open up
wizard>@desc up=This might lead somewhere!
wizard>@fail up=This might lead somewhere!
matthew>up (gives "This might lead somewhere!")

So this is a clue, can matthew build and link
matthew>@dig sponge (37)
matthew>@link up=37 (success)
matthew>@succ up=Up you go
matthew>@osucc up=flies upwards
matthew>@fail up=You do not have the power!
matthew>@ofail up=Failed to go up!
matthew>@desc up=To the sponge
matthew>@open down=11

WARNING: once a lock is set I cannot seem to make it general, i.e. no option for "*". Possibly just do a !fake (fake being the person I create to allow global lock failure) - use @unlock :-)

** TEMPLE **
wizard>@set here=T
wizard>n (or somewhere)
wizard>create tree=20
wizard>@link tree=here
wizard>drop tree

matthew>take tree
matthew>back to temple
matthew>drop tree (get value=(cost/5)-1 = 3)

** home **
@link home=here (want the start not to be limbo - can the wizard change this - YES!!!)

** talking **
say foo (x says "foo")
:foo (x "foo")

** exit **
QUIT (I should use @shutdown to dump db during designing)

Notes:

@open j;jump=<room number>

Should set something to be a temple, for sacrificing!
