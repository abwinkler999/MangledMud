You stand in front of a blue door with a brass number "7" stuck to it. There is an antique buzzer (as in its old) to your left and the sounds of a party drift on the wind. You can go west through the door, or just give up now!

the den
A rectangular room, full of "stuff". A table occupies one wall of the room, it is adorned with computer monitors and assorted mess. A cast off leather settee sits close to the southern wall whilst the eastern wall is struggling to hold an ikea bookcase in place. A greek styled fireplace and small Edinburgh press occupy the northern wall and a grimy window props up the eastern wall. The owners clearly spend quite a bit of time here.

A large white room, probably the "best aspect of the flat". Nothing on the walls due to the residents phobia for nails. A beautifull fireplace graces the southern wall with another press farther along. A room for relaxing in, echoed by the large brown settees gracing both the north and western aspects of the room. A large glass table occupies the eastern wall, splitting the bay window in two. You can go west from here.

kitchen entrance
An "L" shaped squeeze of a room. Devoid of windows the pea-green paint dominates, lovely. Flanking the western wall is an impressive attempt at assembling a kitchen unit. Beginning with a contemporary open space filled with a wine rack and various carrier bags it leads the eye forward toward the oven and end wall. On the eastern wall a make shift recycling "point" tries to pass itself off as a game of Jenga. You can go north or south from here.

Toys and artifacts from a nine year old girl fill the available space. A paleontologist in the making, dinosaurs are the theme here (intermixed with Pokemon) and the floor is somewhat messy. A lovely brass bed greets you at the entrance. The northern wall is hugged by a large and dangerous shelving unit. The western wall hosts another press and the rooms main window. You can go north from here.

Almost worthy of a tate modern installation finished toilet rolls and dead(ish) plants lie beneath a ceiling of mould experiments. The southern wall is occupied by a lovely mirror and hand basin combination. A bath also settles back against the southern wall, the toilet "offers" a welcome to the west. You can go east from here.

The northen wall hosts a bedside "box" and a rather large and unmade bed, flanked by another press. You may go south from here.
