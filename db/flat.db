main door
You stand in front of a blue door with a brass number "7" stuck to it. There is an antique buzzer (as in its old) to your left and the sounds of a party drift on the wind. If you drop an object here, or set its home to be here, you probably won't be able to find it again (that's Polwarth for you). You can go west through the door, or just give up now!

A Greek styled fireplace and small Edinburgh press occupy the northern wall and a grimy window props up the eastern wall. The owners clearly spend quite a bit of time here.

An "L" shaped squeeze of a room. Devoid of windows the pea-green paint dominates, lovely. Flanking the western wall is an impressive attempt at assembling a kitchen unit. Beginning with a contemporary open space filled with a wine rack and various carrier bags it leads the eye forward toward the oven and end wall. On the eastern wall a make shift recycling "point" tries to pass itself off as a game of Jenga. The beginning of the kitchen unit is coated in abandoned paper of varying types. You can go north or south from here.

bookcase
A fine piece of IKEA craftsmanship, this book shelf system occupies the southern corner of the room. It is stuffed with books, covering a set of diverse topics, such as computer programming, tarot reading, break dancing and mechanical engineering. There is a tape nestling in amongst the books and piles of stuff on top of the bookcase too. You can go back north to the main living space.

inside wardrobe
You are inside a spacious wardrobe, or it would be if it wasn't stuffed full of clothing. A good percentage of which seems to be used to occupy coat hanger space rather than the open air. Unsurprising really given the generally naff style sense it conveys. You can exit.

master cupboard
Serving as a dustbin for any object capable of falling over when its door is opened. This small room holds all manner of things. To your left is a boiler, ahead a number of stuffed shelves, the same to your right. There is a magical feeling to this place. You may leave west.

kitchen end
Worth a visit (once), the work-surface tries to impress under the weight of varying bread purchases and random clutter. The fridge dominates here, or would do if it wasn't adorned with half baked magnetic poetry. Clearly a mop would be a wise investment. The fridge door is open, filling the room with a cool breeze. You can go north from here.
