You stand in front of a blue door with a brass number "7" stuck to it. There is an antique buzzer (as in its old) to your left and the sounds of a party drift on the wind. You can go west through the door, or just give up now!

A greek styled fireplace and small Edinburgh press occupy the northern wall and a grimy window props up the eastern wall. The owners clearly spend quite a bit of time here.

A large glass table occupies the eastern wall, splitting the bay window in two. You can go west from here.

Beginning with a contemporary open space filled with a wine rack and various carrier bags it leads the eye forward toward the oven and end wall. On the eastern wall a make shift recycling "point" tries to pass itself off as a game of Jenga. You can go north or south from here.
