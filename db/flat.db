You stand in front of a blue door with a brass number "7" stuck to it. There is an antique buzzer (as in its old) to your left and the sounds of a party drift on the wind. You can go west through the door, or just give up now!

stairwell - bottom
The bottom of a typical Edinburgh tennament stairwell. Rusty bike chains hang from the railing and the floor has some strange puddles of liquid on it. You can go up from here or travel further west.

You head toward a small wooden door, possibly leading to the garden. Hideous noises from the evil pixies of Polwarth make you change your mind and so you head back.

stairwell - 2nd floor
To the south is a welcoming blue door the sounds of conversation and music eminate from behind it, screwed to its surface is a shiny brass nameplate, further down is a brass letter box. There is a doorbell to your left and further to the north is a twisty maze of passages.

the den
A rectangular room, full of "stuff". A table occupies one wall of the room, it is adorned with computer monitors and assorted mess. A cast off leather settee sits close to the southern wall whilst the eastern wall is struggling to hold an ikea bookcase in place. A small Edinburgh press occupies the north east wall and a grimy window props up the eastern wall. The owners clearly spend quite a bit of time here.

You are at the eastern end of the hall. The carpet is splattered with paint from a minor accident (a few years ago). A cupboard lies in front of you (to the south), its opening graced by assorted paraphenalia dropped in transist. You can go east, west or north.

front room
A large white room, probably the "best aspect of the flat". Nothing on the walls due to the residents phobia for nails. A beautifull fireplace graces the southern wall with another press farther along. A room for relaxing in, echoed by the large brown settees gracing both the north and western aspects of the room. A large glass table occupies the eastern wall, splitting the bay window in two. You can go west from here.

kitchen entrance
An "L" shaped squeeze of a room. Devoid of windows the pea-green paint dominates, lovely. Flanking the western wall is an impressive attempt at assembling a kitchen unit. Beginning with a contemporary open space filled with a wine rack and various carrier bags it leads the eye forward toward the oven and end wall. On the eastern wall a make shift recycling "point" tries to pass itself off as a game of Jenga. You can go north or south from here.

kitchen end
Worth a visit (once), the work-surface tries to impress under the weight of varying bread purchases and random clutter. The fridge dominates here, or would do if it wasn't adorned with half baked magnetic poetry. Clearly a mop would be a wise investment. You can go north from here.

freyja's room
Toys and artifacts from a nine year old girl fill the available space. A paleontologist in the making, dinosaurs are the theme here (intermixed with Pokemon) and the floor is somewhat messy. A lovely brass bed greets you at the entrance. The northern wall is hugged by a large and dangerous shelving unit. The western wall hosts another press and the rooms main window. You can go north from here.

bathroom
A cramped, space. The essential facilities of life jostle for attention. Almost worthy of a tate modern installation finished toilet rolls and dead(ish) plants lie beneath a ceiling of mould experiments. The southern wall is occupied by a lovely mirror and hand basin combination. A bath also settles back against the southern wall, the toilet "offers" a welcome to the west. You can go east from here.

A cozy room where the furniture appears to exist as support group for clothing, flannels, socks and other random objects of life as they wander about the surfaces. The southern wall is dominated by a large wooden wardrobe. To your right is a cupboard, onwards lies a chest of drawers. The northen wall hosts a bedside "box" and a rather large and unmade bed, flanked by another press. You may go south from here.
